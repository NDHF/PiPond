        <h3>So what is this, anyway?</h3>
        <p>The Pi Pond calculates Pi by firing cannonballs at random into a pond.</p>
        <h4>The Math</h4>
        <p>Imagine a square whose length is twice the radius of a certain circle. The area of the circle is Pi *
            R<sup>2</sup>.
            The area of the square is the square of its length, L<sup>2</sup>. Since the length of the square is twice
            the radius of the circle,
            we can write the area of the square as (2R)<sup>2</sup>, or 4R<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is Pi * R<sup>2</sup> / 4R<sup>2</sup>, or Pi /
            4. Therefore, Pi is equal to the ratio between the two areas, multiplied by 4.</p>
            <p>By plotting coordinates onto the field (the square) at random, and checking which coordinates fall within the pond (the circle), 
                we can approximate the area of the two shapes. The more random coordinates that are plotted, the closer the approximation of Pi.</p>
        <p>It was inspired by a challenge in A.K. Dewdney's <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Armchair-Universe-Exploration-Computer-Worlds/dp/0716719398"><i>The
                    Armchair Universe</i></a>, a collection of articles about computers from Scientific American.
        </p>
        <p>The Pi Pond was programmed using Vanilla JS and the HTML5 Canvas element.</p>
