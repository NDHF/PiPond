        <h3><i>SO WHAT IS THIS, ANYWAY?</i></h3>
        <p>The <b>&pi; Pond</b> calculates &pi; (Pi) by firing cannonballs at random into a pond.</p>
        <p>In its own, strange, way, the &pi; Pond is a way of getting <strong>data out of randomness</strong>.</p>
        <h4>THE MATH(S)</h4>
        <p>Imagine a square and a circle of equal width.</p>
        <img class="illo" src="assets/images/illustration-01.svg" />
        <p>The area of the circle is, of course, &pi;r<sup>2</sup>, which means the area of the square is (2r)<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <img class="illo" src="assets/images/illustration-02.svg" />
        <p>(2r)<sup>2</sup> is the same as (2r)(2r), and can be simplified to 4r<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <img class="illo" src="assets/images/illustration-03.svg" />
        <p>The ratio of the two areas is &pi;r<sup>2</sup> divided by 4r<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <img class="illo" src="assets/images/illustration-04.svg" />
        <p>The r<sup>2</sup>'s cancel each other out&hellip;</p>
        <img class="illo" src="assets/images/illustration-05.svg" />
        <p>&hellip;leaving us with &pi; divided by four.</p>
        <img class="illo" src="assets/images/illustration-06.svg" />
        <p>If we multiply the ratio by four, we can get &pi; by itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Therefore, &pi; is the ratio of the area of a circle and the area of a square,
            multiplied by four.
        </strong></p>
        <p>In the case of the <b>&pi; Pond</b>, &pi; is approximated as the number of cannonballs that land in the pond,
            divided by the total number of cannonballs fired, multiplied by four.
        </p>
        <p>By plotting coordinates onto the field (the square) at random, and checking which coordinates fall within the
            pond (the circle),
            we can approximate the area of the two shapes. The more random coordinates that are plotted, the closer the
            approximation of &pi;.</p>
        <p>The <strong>&pi; Pond</strong> plots random coordinates (the cannonballs) onto a grid (the pond). By counting 
        the number of shots that land in the pond, versus the total number of shots fired, the program can approximate 
        the ratio of the two areas. When this ratio is multiplied by four, you get an approximation of &pi;.</p>
        <p>The <strong>&pi; Pond</strong> is limited by resolution, and by limitations of the random-number generator used.</p>
        <p>The program is currently using JavaScript's built-in Math.random() method, which in turn is probably using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift">xorshift128+</a> algorithm
            adopted by most web browsers. xorshift128+ produces numbers which <em>appear</em> random enough, 
            but are far from truly random.</p>
        <p>Even then, the <strong>&pi; Pond</strong> will consistently return 3.1 after 1,000 shots.</p>
        <h3>INS&pi;RATION</h3>
        <p>The <b>&pi; Pond</b> was inspired by a challenge in A.K. Dewdney's <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Armchair-Universe-Exploration-Computer-Worlds/dp/0716719398"><i>The
                    Armchair Universe</i></a>, a collection of articles about recreational computer science from
            <i>Scientific American</i>.
        </p>
        <p>The <b>&pi; Pond</b> was programmed using Vanilla JS and the HTML5 Canvas element.</p>
